                <h2>Design Principles</h2>

                <p>The design of the OPeNDAP software is based on the following two considerations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Data are often most appropriately distributed by the individual
                        or group that has developed them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user will in general like to access data from the application software
                        with which they are most familiar.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This has resulted in a highly distributed system that allows users to control the
                    distribution of their own data and the way they access data from remote sites.

                <h2>User Application <mat-icon>arrow_forward</mat-icon> DAP Client</h2>
                <p>
                    Once a user's data analysis application (or API) is made network-savvy
                    with the OPeNDAP tools, the scope of an application's search for data
                    is extended, because remote data becomes as accessible as local data.
                    A DAP-enabled application can...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get any data anywhere on the web that is served by a DAP server.</li>
                    <li>Use data from any DAP server, regardless of its native format.</li>
                    <li>Still perform all its original functions for accessing data locally.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The truly remarkable part: you don't have to rewrite the code to
                    enable many applications to work as a DAP clients.

                <h2>Not Just Oceanography</h2>
                <p>
                    Although the OPeNDAP software was originally designed and developed
                    by oceanographers and computer scientists for oceanographic data
                    (as part of the DODS and NVODS projects),
                    there is nothing in the design of the OPeNDAP software that constrains its use
                    to oceanography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indeed, it has been adopted by the High Altitude Observatory community
                    and is being considered by segments of the meteorological and space science communities.

                <p>
                    OPeNDAP software is open-source and is intended to facilitate building
                    community-driven projects for developing end-to-end systems that can locate,
                    understand, access, and use scientific data. OPeNDAP has already developed
                    a flexible data model, a transport protocol, and several software
                    frameworks, including...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C++ and Java implementations of the data model and transport protocol</li>
                    <li>A set of DODS servers</li>
                    <li>A set of DODS clients</li>

                <p>
                    OPeNDAP allows you to access remote data over the web...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using familiar data analysis and visualization packages, such as Matlab, Ferret, and IDL.</li>
                    <li>Without worrying about data storage formats.</li>
                    <li>Accessing only the data of interest.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    OPeNDAP also allows you to make your data available remotely.
                    Your data can be in a variety of formats, including netCDF, HDF, and
                    <a href="https://www.opendap.org/support/OPeNDAP-servers">many more</a>.

                        Hyrax uses a modular design that employs a lightweight Java servlet to provide the
                        public-accessible
                        client interface, and a back-end daemon, the BES, to handle the heavy lifting. The BES uses the
                        same
                        handlers that are used with Server3 (also know as the CGI Server) but loads those at run time.
